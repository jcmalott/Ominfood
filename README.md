# Ominfood
Omnifood is a site that I worked on within Udemys, Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3, course. The way that I learn projects like this is to follow along and create the site as I am learing. Take a day or two off and then make the site without any help from the course. If for some reason I did look at the course for help I start from scratch and repeat this step till I make the site without help.

This is the finsihed project with no help from the course.

### Skills:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JQuery
- Javascript
